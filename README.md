Pardinus
=======

Pardinus is Kodkod's (slightly bulkier) Iberian cousin

This repository includes the source code for the Pardinus solver, an extension to the [Kodkod](http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/index.html) solver for relational logic. It extends Kodkod with the following functionalities:
* Target-oriented and weighted-target oriented model finding
* Decomposed parallelized model finding
* Model finding over temporal relational formulas
* Support for unbounded relational model finding (planned)

Pardinus is developed at the High-Assurance Software Laboratory ([HASLab](http://haslab.di.uminho.pt)), from INESC TEC and University of Minho, and is led by Alcino Cunha and Nuno Macedo. It is used as a back-end for [Electrum Analyzer](), an extension to the Alloy Analyzer.

Pardinus is open-source and available under the [MIT license](LICENSE), as is Kodkod. However, the implementation relies on third-party solvers ([SAT4J](http://www.sat4j.org), [MiniSat](http://minisat.se), [Glucose/Syrup](http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/), [(P)Lingeling](http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/), and [Yices](http://yices.csl.sri.com)), some of which are released under stricter licenses (see the various LICENSE files in the distribution for details)

Pardinus can be built and run following the instructions from [Kodkod](https://github.com/emina/kodkod/blob/master/README.md#building-and-installing-kodkod).
